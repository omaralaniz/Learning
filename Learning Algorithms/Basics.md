# Basics

No your bounds! What is valid input. The algorithm should be explicitly defined and have the proper instructions (specific order). The algorithm will always  end and never infinite. 

Clear problem statement, input, and output.

## Good Algorithm

### Efficiency

An efficient algorithm finds a balance between the two. An algorithm can be fast but it can take up too much memory, and an algorithm can take up a small amount of memory but will run reaaaalllllllly slooooooow.

#### Time Complexity

How quickly an algorithm is ran

 #### Space Complexity

How much memory that algorithm takes up not including the original

### Big O aka O (n)

Order of magnitude of complexity; measures the complexity as the size grows. 

Upper Bound

| Big O       | Runtime                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| O (1)       | Constant Runtime                |
| O (log n)   | Logarithmic Runtime (Sublinear) |
| O (n^2)     | Quadratic Runtime               |
| O (n^3)     | Cubic Runtime                   |
| O (n log n) | Quasilinear                     |
| O (n ^k)    | Polynomial                      |
| O (x ^n)    | Exponential                     |
| O (n!)      | Factorial                       |
